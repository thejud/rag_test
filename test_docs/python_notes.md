# Python Programming Notes

## Best Practices

Python is a versatile programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Here are some key best practices:

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

### Data Structures
- Lists are ordered and mutable
- Dictionaries provide key-value mapping
- Sets contain unique elements
- Tuples are immutable sequences

### Error Handling
Use try-catch blocks for proper error handling:
```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Performance Tips
- Use list comprehensions when appropriate
- Avoid global variables
- Use generators for memory efficiency
- Profile your code to identify bottlenecks
