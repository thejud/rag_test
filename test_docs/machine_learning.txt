Machine Learning Concepts

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: classification, regression
   - Algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, neural networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
   - Algorithms: k-means, PCA, autoencoders

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learning through interaction with environment
   - Uses rewards and penalties
   - Applications: game playing, robotics

Key Concepts:
- Training data: Dataset used to train the model
- Features: Input variables used for prediction
- Target: Output variable being predicted
- Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Cross-validation: Technique to assess model performance

Popular Libraries:
- scikit-learn: General-purpose ML library
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework
- PyTorch: Research-focused deep learning
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
